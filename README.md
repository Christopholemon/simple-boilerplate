# Simple Boilerplate
For really simple web projects, generally hosted locally. It's pretty rough, but should be good enough for coding tests, proof of concepts, or generally dicking around with stuff.

Local build is currently using webpack dev server, but I am also working on a Mac so running a basic PHP server on the output director works too, eg. __php -S localhost:3000__.
